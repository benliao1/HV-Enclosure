# All BOMs

This document contains tables of parts, supplier links, and other notes on all the parts used for the enclosure, first for the individual components, then by supplier for all the necessary components to build one enclosure compiled into a series of tables.

## PCBs

These BOMs contain the components needed to build **one** of the specified PCB with no attachments. They are duplicated in the Altium Smart BOMs. They do not include components that are not modeled in Altium, such as the contactors, bleeder resistors, and JST connector wires. See the BOMs for the [High Voltage Electrical Box and Auxiliary High Voltage Electrical Box](#electrical_box_boms) for those line entries.

## High Voltage Electrical Box

The length of the M6 bolts used to connect the HV Board with the contactors is around 20 mm but I (Ben) could be wrong. I bought the ones used for the prototype from ACE hardware and it's unclear exactly how long they were. Please correct if necessary. The length of the M6 bolts used to connect the HV Board with the bleed resistors can be adjusted if necessary. Additionally, the 1/4-20 screws for securing the side heat sink to the aluminum L bracket may not be 1/2" long, they might be even shorter than that. You cannot use the screws provided with the L bracket there because they are too long and would hit the acrylic and Main Board.

# Entire Enclosure

The following is a list of BOMs to make one high voltage enclosure, organized by supplier. There may be some small items missing, especially in the order for McMaster, since I (Ben) did not ever order everything all at once to make the enclosure... please update this if necessary! I tried my best to make it as accurate as possible by reading receipts, but I may have missed a couple things or miscounted how many I used.
