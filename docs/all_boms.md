# All BOMs

This document contains tables of parts, supplier links, and other notes on all the parts used for the enclosure, first for the individual components, then by supplier for all the necessary components to build one enclosure compiled into a series of tables.

## PCBs

These BOMs contain the components needed to build **one** of the specified PCB with no attachments. They are duplicated in the Altium Smart BOMs. They do not include components that are not modeled in Altium, such as the contactors, bleeder resistors, and JST connector wires. See the BOMs for the High Voltage Electrical Box and Auxiliary High Voltage Electrical Box for those line entries.
