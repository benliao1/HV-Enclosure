# Suppliers and Ordering

This document lists where all of the components were ordered from and what options were chosen for those components (copper thickness of PCBs, 3D print material, etc.).

## PCBs

PCBs were ordered from JLCPCB. Options for the various boards are as follows:

- Main Board: 1 oz outer copper, 1/2 oz inner copper, HASL surface finish (leaded)
- HV Board: 2 oz outer copper, 2 oz inner copper, HASL surface finish (leaded)
- Aux HV Board: 2 oz outer copper, 2 oz inner copper, HASL surface finish (leaded)
- Button Board: 1 oz outer copper, HASL surface finish (leaded)

## PCB Stencils

Stencils were ordered from OSH Stencils. The HV Board and the Aux HV Board have the same stencil (this was intentional, to eliminate confusion between the two). Of course, the Button Board does not need a stencil. The options for the three stencils were as follows: 

- Stainless steel, 4mil thickness

## 3D Printed Button Holder

The button holder was ordered from Xometry, using the following options:

- Technology: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
- Material: Protyping PLA (FFF)
- Color: next available (doesn't matter)
- Finish: Standard

## Acrylic

These were ordered from Sendcutsend. Options for these components were as follows:

- Material: Acrylic-Clear
- Thickness: 0.177"
- No post-processing options

## Aluminum Heat Sinks

These were ordered from Sendcutsend. Options for these components were as follows:

- Material: 6061 T6 Aluminum
- Thickness: 0.125"
- Post-processing options: Deburring

## 20 Series Beams and Fasteners

These were ordered from [8020.net](8020.net). See `all_boms.md` for full list of components ordered from this website.

## Screws, Nuts, Bolts, Aluminum L brackets for Heat Sinks

These were ordered from McMaster-Carr.

## 120 V - 12 V AC/DC Converter, Gate Latch, Cover Handle, Nylon Spacers

These were ordered from Amazon.
