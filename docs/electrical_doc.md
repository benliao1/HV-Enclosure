# Electrical Design Documentation

This document contains information on the design process for the electrical portion of the enclosure, notes on working on and editing the files/design, and the parameters that can be changed.

**It should be noted that much of the electronics is actually explained in the Altium schematics. Please read those for very detailed explanations of how the electrical circuitry actually works.** Thus, there will not be any documentation in this document explaining how the boards works.

## Schematic Rules

The schematics were made very carefully with a mind towards ease of understanding, good organization, and self-documentation. Generally, logic and power flow from left to right, top to bottom. Each section is demarcated with thick dark red boxes, and with a comment explaining the purpose and various quirks (if any) of that particular section.
